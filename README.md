This is part (beside the assignment) of what I did in the Complex Networks course I attendend at Università degli studi di Palermo in AA 2022/2023, under prof. Salvatore Miccichè.

note: most of the lessons and the codes are commented in english, the examination is in italian but I think it can be easily translated online because the language used is simple.
note: the file containing the original airport data is missing due to the limit of 100MB in github.
