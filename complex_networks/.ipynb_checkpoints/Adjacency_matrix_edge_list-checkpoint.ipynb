    "### If we represent a network with an adjacency matrix, (a graph, see custom data structures), we make a matrix with nxn squares, n= number of nodes, but the matrix is symmetrical (if the connections are not directional), and on the diagonal is full of 0s, because there are no self connections.\n",
    "### The matrix represents a link if theres a 1 in the posizion M\\[2\\]\\[3\\] so between nodes number 3 and 4 (python counts from 0)\n",
    "### So we don't have n^2 information, just (n^2-n)/2, so n(n-1)/2, because it's symmetrical ( the fraction 2) and we have no information on the diagonal (the minus n).\n",
    "### If we sum the elements in a column or row we find the degree of a node."
